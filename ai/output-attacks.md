# Output Attacks

Many common security vulnerabilities arise from improper handling of untrusted data. Arguably the most common attack vector is an `Injection Attack`. Typical examples in the web domain include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where untrusted data is inserted into the HTML DOM, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code; SQL Injection, where untrusted data is inserted into SQL queries, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL queries; and code injection, where untrusted data is inserted into system commands, leading to the execution of arbitrary system commands.

Text generated by `Large Language Models (LLMs)` needs to be treated as untrusted data since there is no direct control over the LLM's response.&#x20;
